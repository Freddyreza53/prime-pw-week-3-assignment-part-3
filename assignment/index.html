    <!-- create an ordered list with any questions you have on this week's material -->
    <ol>
      <li>Should we be using === over ==?</li>
      <li>Does a 'for loop' always have to have 'i++' or 'i--' in the paranthesis? If so, can
        we do something like 'i - 7' if we wanted to decrease i by 7 each time?</li>
      <li>Is there a function that allows us to order an array or would we need to use loops?</li>
    </ol>
